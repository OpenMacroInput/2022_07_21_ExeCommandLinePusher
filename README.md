# 2022_07_21_ExeCommandLinePusher
This small visual studio in C# app, allows to push command line from in the window terminal.


I have not design this tool yet. But the idea is simple.
You add this app to the path like for a JDK

When call it will push the command you request to OMI through File, UDP or "shared Memory" based on the files near the exe.
